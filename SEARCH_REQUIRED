# Since the exact file path is not provided in the error log, we need to:
# 1. Search for Python files that use 'json.' or 'json.loads' or 'json.dumps' without importing json
# 2. Common locations to check:
#    - build scripts (build.py, setup.py, configure.py)
#    - CI/CD scripts in .github/, .gitlab/, jenkins/
#    - deployment scripts
#    - Any Python file in the root directory
#
# The fix is to add at the top of the identified file(s):
# import json
#
# This should be added after any __future__ imports but before other standard library imports.
#
# Example fix pattern:
# #!/usr/bin/env python3
# # existing comments
# import json  # <-- ADD THIS LINE
# import os
# import sys
# ... rest of the code
